## Ecological model of phylosymbiosis


Code associated with the paper **Is host filtering the main driver of phylosymbiosis across the tree of life?** by Florent Mazel, Katherine Davis, Andrew Loudon, Waldan Kwong, Mathieu Groussin and Laura Wegener Parfrey


This page provides the R functions necessary to reproduce the simulations presented in the paper as well as a short tutorial to guide the users to use our model. 

The ecological model is based on the work developped by L. Gallien and T. Münkemüller: 

Münkemüller T, Gallien L. 2015. *VirtualCom: a simulation model for eco-evolutionary community assembly and invasion.* Methods Ecol Evol 6:735–743.
